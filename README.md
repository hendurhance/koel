## About Koel

Koel is a free, open-source, self-hosted exchange rate API that provides real-time currency conversion data by aggregating information from multiple data sources through web scraping. Built on an event-driven, fault-tolerant architecture, Koel eliminates usage limits and API key requirements, giving you complete control over your currency dataâ€”whether you deploy it on your own server or within a Docker container.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data Aggregation:** Scrapes multiple sources to gather the latest exchange rates.
- **Self-Hosted:** Deploy Koel on your own infrastructure without relying on third-party APIs.
- **Fault-Tolerant:** Uses a factory pattern and multiple data sources to ensure data availability even if one source fails.
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Background tasks powered by Celery for regular and scheduled scrapes.
- **High Performance:** Optimized for high-volume writes and fast read operations with techniques such as denormalization, bulk upserts, and partitioning.
- **No Usage Limits:** Enjoy unlimited requests with no API keys required.
- **Client-Side Friendly:** Easily integrate with browser or mobile applications.
- **Docker Support:** Containerize your deployment for consistency and ease of use.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** â€“ The project is built with Python and uses modern asynchronous libraries.
- **PostgreSQL 10+** â€“ Recommended for its native partitioning support.
- **Redis** â€“ Used for caching, which is required for the application to run and keep track of jobs.
- **Celery** â€“ For background tasks and scheduling.
- **Alembic** â€“ For database migrations.
- **Docker & Docker Compose** (optional) â€“ For containerized deployment.

### Background Tasks
Koel uses Celery to run background tasks for scraping data from multiple sources. The tasks are defined in the `app/tasks/celery_app.py` directory. You can run the Celery worker using the following command:

```bash
celery -A app.tasks.celery_app worker --loglevel=info
```
This will start the Celery worker and listen for tasks to execute. You can also run the Celery beat scheduler to schedule periodic tasks:

```bash
celery -A app.tasks.celery_app beat --loglevel=info
```
### Caching
Koel uses Redis for caching the exchange rates to improve performance and run job and tasks. You can configure the caching settings in the `.env` file. By default, Koel uses a Redis instance running on `localhost:6379`. You can change the Redis URL in the `.env` file:
```env
CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://localhost:6379/1
CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND=redis://localhost:6379/1

REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_DB=1
REDIS_PASSWORD=
```
### Database
Koel uses PostgreSQL as the database backend. You can configure the database settings in the `.env` file. By default, Koel uses a PostgreSQL instance running on `localhost:5432`. You can change the database URL in the `.env` file:
```env
DB_CONNECTION=postgresql
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_NAME=koel
```
## Sources
Koel scrapes data from multiple sources to provide accurate and up-to-date exchange rates. The sources are defined in the `app/scraping/sources` directory. You can add or modify the sources by creating new classes that extend the `BaseScraper` class.
